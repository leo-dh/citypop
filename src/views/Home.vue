          <h2>Origins</h2>
          <p class="mt-6">
            It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's Western-influenced 'new music', but
            came to include a wide range of styles associated with the country's nascent economic
            boom, such as AOR, soft rock, R&B, funk, and boogie.
            <br />
            <br />
            It was also associated with new emerging technologies, such as the Walkman, cars with
            built-in cassette decks and FM stereos, and various electronic musical instruments.

          <h2>21st Century</h2>
          <p class="mt-6">
            Though the golden age of city pop has long passed, the genre is slowly finding its
            relevance in the 21st century through other offshoot genres like vaporwave and
            futurefunk.
            <br />
            <br />
            One prime example is Plastic Love by Mariya Takeuchi. The song, released in 1984, was
            favoured by Youtube’s recommendation algorithm, giving it the attention it never had
            when it was first released.

        <div>
          <h2>Sound Signature</h2>
          <p class="mt-6">
            City pop does not have a definite sound signature, it can sound like anything from soft,
            album-oriented rock to sophisticated boogie disco.
            <br />
            <br />
            Given that city pop is an opulent amalgamation multiple music genres, ‘City pop’ is less
            a strict genre term but rather a broad vibe classification, an aesthetic experience.
